Expo tutorial project, the purpose is to read the photos in the phone and display them in the APP.

ExpoSensor:
Use Expo to program the APP to read the data of the mobile phone, including pedometer, accelerometer, and gyroscope.

SensorDataAnlysize:
Perform data analysis on UCI HAR and the data measured by yourself. Look for parameters to distinguish different behavior patterns.

DataSimulation:
The simulation generates 30 days of data and extends it to 180 days. On this basis, we train different time series models to predict people's next behavior.
